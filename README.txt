Project Description (FOLLOW CLOSELY)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Java-based application proposes to create an online discussion platform 
that  will  consist  of  a  wide  range  of  questions  on  different  topics,  fields,  and 
subjects. By creating a user-friendly environment of Bluebook 
implementation, this application is a resourceful tool for individuals who wish 
to practice mock quizzes and tests. Online quiz management system is one of 
the interesting java projects. 
In this project, you will build a comprehensive online platform for managing 
both  quiz  competitions  and  the  participants  in  the  different  teams.  This 
application can be used by academic institutions and any organization willing 
to find suitable candidates through the process of quizzing. 
The application permits multiple admins, each having their unique user id and 
password. While admins can create an “n” number of participating teams for a 
quiz, they can also set an “n” number of rounds for the quiz. All the participants 
will  automatically  receive  the  questions,  and  the  teams  will  have  to  answer 
within an allotted time.
